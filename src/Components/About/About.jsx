            My name is Thaw Zin Tun and I'm a frontend developer based in Yangon{" "}
          </h5>
          <p>
            As a frontend developer, I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and other frameworks and libraries and am skilled at
            building responsive and user-friendly websites and applications. I
            am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date
            on the latest technologies and best practices in the field and am
            eager to learn more and put my skills to use in real-world projects.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am a computer science student from University of Yangon, and have
            completed a number of courses and certifications to enhance my
            knowledge and skills as a developer. I have also gained valuable
            experience working on a variety of frontend development projects as
            part of my studies. I am highly motivated and proactive in my
            learning, and am always looking for opportunities to grow and
            improve as a developer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While I do not have professional experience as a frontend developer,
            I am confident in my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new
            technologies and challenges. I am a fast learner with strong
            problem-solving skills, and believe that my passion for frontend
            development and my willingness to learn and grow make me an asset to
            any team.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am excited to begin my career as a frontend developer and to
            contribute my skills and enthusiasm to projects that make a
            difference.
